In a provider, a yaml file is created in the content/miq_dialogs folder. It follows a specific pattern and the fields within are not arbitrary. Use the [JSON schema](https://jaredm-ibm.github.io/miq_plugin_dev/schemas/cloud_manager_provision.json) in this repo to assist in creating the YAML file.

How the yaml file is processed for display is controlled by the haml files in the [manageiq-classic-ui](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-ui-classic) repo. The container definition is within the [_prov_dialog.html.haml](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-ui-classic/blob/master/app/views/shared/views/_prov_dialog.html.haml). From there depending on which container is being processed other files will be included. The most common is in [ prov_dialog_fieldset](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-ui-classic/blob/master/app/views/miq_request/_prov_dialog_fieldset.html.haml). The field definitions are from [_prov_field.html.haml](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-ui-classic/blob/master/app/views/miq_request/_prov_field.html.haml). The volumes container is defined in [prov_dialog_volume_fieldset.html.haml](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-ui-classic/blob/master/app/views/miq_request/_prov_dialog_volume_fieldset.html.haml)
